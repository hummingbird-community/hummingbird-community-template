# Hummingbird Community Template

Template applied to all repositories in the hummingbird-community organisation. Any updates to this template will create PRs in all the other repositories reflecting those updates.

It is possible to customize this template by adding a `.hummingbird-community-template.yml` configuration file in the base of your repository. You can use [default.yml](https://github.com/hummingbird-community/hummingbird-community-template/blob/main/default.yml) as a basis for building your own configuration.
